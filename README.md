# Take part in the CORD-19 Research Challenge
10 key questions as tasks and 10 ways you can help the world to understand and recover from coronavirus faster. Major AI initiatives and The White House have come together and made available over 44,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19 and related coronaviruses for you to help answer questions the scientific community is asking and win cash prizes.

This notebook focused in Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that processes and understands large amounts of unstructured human language. Also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction. NER extraction is the first step in answering questions, retrieving information and topic modelling. There are many models for implementing NER depending on the application need. Here we compare Spacy pre-trained and Stanford NER models.

The most importan configuration models are:

|      Model     |                                        Description                                       |
|:--------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| en_core_sci_sm |            A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~100k vocabulary.            |
| en_core_sci_md | A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~360k vocabulary and 50k word vectors.  |
| en_core_sci_lg | A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~785k vocabulary and 600k word vectors. |
